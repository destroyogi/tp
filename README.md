Here are the steps to install Python in Windows 10, create a virtual environment, install requirements, and start working:

1. Download the latest version of Python from the official website at https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/. Choose the appropriate version (32-bit or 64-bit) based on your system architecture. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install Python on your system.

2. Open a Command Prompt window (press Windows key + R, type "cmd", and press Enter) or a PowerShell window (press Windows key + R, type "powershell", and press Enter).

3. Type the following command to create a new virtual environment:

```
python -m venv myenv
```

4. Replace "myenv" with the name you want to give to your virtual environment. This will create a new directory with the specified name and set up a new Python environment inside it.

5. Activate the virtual environment by typing the following command:

```
myenv\Scripts\activate
```

6. This will activate the virtual environment, and you should see the name of your virtual environment in the Command Prompt or PowerShell prompt.

7. Install the requirements by typing the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

8. This will install all the required packages in your virtual environment.

9. Start working on your application. You can create a new Python file and start writing your code. When you're ready to run your application, use the following command:

```
python hello.py
```

10. This will start the Flask development server, and you should be able to access your application by going to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.

That's it! You now have Python installed on your Windows 10 system, a virtual environment set up, and all the required packages installed. You can start working on your application and building out your functionality.
